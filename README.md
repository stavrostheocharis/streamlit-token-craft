Here‚Äôs a very simple example on how to unleash the power of the Token Craft in your app:

```python
import streamlit as st
from token_craft import st_token_table

mock_tokens = [
    {
        "id": "token98a1c077",
        "key": "token98-e316-49d9",
        "display_key": "token98a...e5437d75",
        "name": "Token 1",
        "dateCreated": "2023-12-20",
        "lastUsed": "Never",
        "is_active": True,
    },
]

rendered_tokens = st_token_table(
    tokens=mock_tokens,
    key="token_table",
)
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that the functionality of this component has to be combined with your token management service.
>
>For more complex functionality have a look at [demo full app](demo_full_app.py) & [demo for column selection](demo_col_selection_app.py).
